                <p> Abstract: The traditional knowledge-based approaches to question answering might seem irrelevant now that Neural QA, particularly Large Language Models show almost human performance in question answering. Knowing what was successful in the past and which elements are essential to getting the right answers, however, is needed to inform further developments in the neural approaches and help address the known shortcomings of LLMs. This talk, therefore, will provide an overview of the approaches to biomedical question answering as they were evolving. It will cover information needs of various stakeholders and the resources created to address these information needs through Question Answering. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Artificial intelligence could fundamentally transform clinical workflows in image-based diagnostics and population screening, promising more objective, accurate and effective analysis of medical images. A major hurdle for using medical imaging AI in clinical practice, however, is the assurance whether it is safe for patients and continues to be safe after deployment. Differences in patient populations and changes in the data acquisition pose challenges to today's AI algorithms. In this talk we will discuss AI safeguards from the perspective of robustness, reliability, and fairness. We will explore approaches for automatic failure detection, monitoring of performance, and analysis of bias, aiming to ensure the safe and ethical use of medical imaging AI. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Digital traces, such as social media data, supported with advances in the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) fields, are increasingly being used to understand the mental health of individuals, communities, and populations. However, such algorithms do not exist in a vacuum -- there is an intertwined relationship between what an algorithm does and the world it exists in. Consequently, with algorithmic approaches offering promise to change the status quo in mental health for the first time since mid-20th century, interdisciplinary collaborations are paramount. But what are some paradigms of engagement for AL/ML researchers that augment existing algorithmic capabilities while minimizing the risk of harm? Adopting a social ecological lens, this talk will describe the experiences from working with different stakeholders in research initiatives relating to digital mental health – including with healthcare providers, grassroots advocacy and public health organizations, and people with the lived experience of mental illness. The talk hopes to present some lessons learned by way of these engagements, and to reflect on a path forward that empowers us to go beyond technical innovations to envisioning contributions that center humans’ needs, expectations, values, and voices within those technical artifacts. </p>

In this tutorial, we will give insight into the implementation, deployment, integration, and evaluation steps following the building of a clinical model. Specifically, we will discuss each step in the context of informing design choices as you build a model. For example, aggressive feature selection is a necessary step toward integration as real time data streams of all the data points a machine learning model may consume may not be accessible or feasible. We will use our implementation and evaluation of a Covid-19 adverse event model at our institution as a representative case study. This case study will demonstrate the full lifecycle of a clinical model and how we transition from a model to affecting patient outcome and the socio-technical challenges for success. </p>

However, many practical and technical challenges, such as data privacy, high-dimensionality and heterogeneity across different datasets, remain to be addressed. In this talk, I will introduce several methods for the effective and efficient integration of electronic health records and other healthcare datasets. Specifically, we develop communication-efficient distributed algorithms for jointly analyzing multiple datasets without the need of sharing patient-level data. Our algorithms can account for heterogeneity across different datasets. We provide theoretical guarantees for the performance of our algorithms, and examples of implementing the algorithms to real-world clinical research networks. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Digital health technologies provide promising ways to deliver interventions outside of clinical settings. Wearable sensors and mobile phones provide real-time data streams that provide information about an individual’s current health including both internal (e.g., mood) and external (e.g., location) contexts. This tutorial discusses the algorithms underlying mobile health clinical trials. Specifically, we introduce the micro-randomized trial (MRT), an experimental design for optimizing real time interventions. We define the causal excursion effect and discuss reasons why this effect is often considered the primary causal effect of interest in MRT analysis. We introduce statistical methods for primary and secondary analyses for MRT.  Attendees will have access to synthetic digital health experimental data to better understand online learning and experimentation algorithms, the systems underlying real time delivery of treatment, and their evaluation using collected data. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Does increasing the dosage of a drug treatment cause adverse reactions in patients? This is a causal question: did increased drug dosage cause some patients to have an adverse reaction, or would they have had the reaction anyway due to other factors? A classical approach to studying this causal question from observational data involves applying causal inference techniques to observed measurements of all the relevant clinical variables. However, there is a growing recognition that abundant text data, such as medical records, physicians' notes, or even forum posts from online medical communities, provide a rich source of information for causal inference. In this tutorial, I'll introduce causal inference and highlight the unique challenges that high-dimensional and noisy text data pose. Then, I'll use two text applications involving online forums and consumer complaints to motivate recent approaches that extend natural language processing (NLP) methods in service of causal inference. I'll discuss some new assumptions we need to introduce to bridge the gap between noisy text data and valid causal inference. I'll conclude by summarizing open research questions at the intersection of causal inference and text analysis. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Data visualization is essential for analyzing biomedical and public health data and communicating the findings to key stakeholders. However, the presence of a data visualization is not enough; the choices we make when visualizing data are equally important in establishing its understandability and impact. This tutorial will discuss strategies for visualizing data and evaluating its impact with an appropriate target audience. The aim is to build an intuition for developing and assessing visualizations by drawing on theories of visualization theories together with examples from prior research and ongoing attempts to visualize the present pandemic. </p>
              
              
                <p> Bio: Ana Crisan is currently a senior research scientist at Tableau, a Salesforce company. She conducts interdisciplinary research that integrates techniques and methods from machine learning, human computer interaction, and data visualization. Her research focuses on the intersection of Data Science and Data Visualization, especially toward the way humans can collaboratively work together with ML/AI systems through visual interfaces.

                <p> Value-Based Care (VBC) is getting its momentum. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is pushing to have all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries under a care relationship with accountability for quality and total cost of care by 2030. However, the business of VBC is more complex and is different from other businesses as it needs to satisfy three-part aims simultaneously; they are 1) better care for individuals, 2) better health for populations, and 3) lower cost. Meeting all three aims is challenging, and the details and implications of these aims are not well-known for healthcare machine learning researchers. Therefore, we want to pick a few papers from this and past years' CHIL proceedings. Then, we would like to brainstorm and discuss how those ideas in the papers can be deployed in practice, what are the barriers to the deployment/sales, what are the hidden or visible incentives for adopting such ideas, how the government and policymakers should incentivize to achieve the three-part aims of CMS while encouraging the adoption of such technologies. </p>
              
              
                <p> Bio: Yubin Park, Ph.D., is Chief Data and Analytics Officer at Apollo Medical Holdings, Inc. (ApolloMed, NASDAQ: AMEH). He oversees value-based care analytics, remote patient monitoring, and partnerships with third-party data vendors in his current position. Yubin started his career by founding a healthcare analytics start-up after obtaining his Ph.D. degree in Machine Learning at the University of Texas at Austin in 2014. His first start-up, Accordion Health, provided an AI-driven Risk Adjustment and Quality analytics platform to Medicare Advantage plans. In 2017, Evolent Health (NYSE: EVH) acquired his company, and there, he led various clinical transformation/innovation projects. In 2020, he then founded his second start-up, Orma Health. The company built a virtual care and analytics platform for payers and providers in value-based care, e.g., Direct Contracting Entities and Accountable Care Organizations. At Orma, he worked with many sizes of risk-bearing primary care and specialty groups, helping them connect with patients through virtual care technologies. ApolloMed acquired Orma Health in 2022. </p>

                <p> Machine learning algorithms should be easy to evaluate for performance and equity: they generate quantitative predictions that can be compared to their intended target, both in the general population and in under-served groups. But the scarcity of data means that, for most algorithms, we have no idea how they perform, and how much bias they contain. Concretely, there is no way for algorithm developers or potential users to answer the simple question: does this algorithm do what it’s supposed to do? This roundtable will focus on the opportunities and challenges of auditing algorithm performance and equity. </p>
