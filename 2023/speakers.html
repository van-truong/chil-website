                <p> Abstract: The traditional knowledge-based approaches to question answering might seem irrelevant now that Neural QA, particularly Large Language Models show almost human performance in question answering. Knowing what was successful in the past and which elements are essential to getting the right answers, however, is needed to inform further developments in the neural approaches and help address the known shortcomings of LLMs. This talk, therefore, will provide an overview of the approaches to biomedical question answering as they were evolving. It will cover information needs of various stakeholders and the resources created to address these information needs through Question Answering. </p>
              
              
                <p> Bio: Dina Demner-Fushman, MD, PhD is a Tenure Track Investigator in the Computational Health Research Branch at LHNCBC. She specializes in artificial intelligence and natural language processing, with a focus on information extraction and textual data analysis, EMR data analysis, and image and text retrieval for clinical decision support and education. Dr. Demner-Fushman's research aims to improve healthcare through the development of computational methods that can process and analyze clinical data more effectively. Her research led to the current iteration of the MEDLINE resource, which helps people navigate a plethora of NLM resources, as well as Open-i, which helps finding biomedical images. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Artificial intelligence could fundamentally transform clinical workflows in image-based diagnostics and population screening, promising more objective, accurate and effective analysis of medical images. A major hurdle for using medical imaging AI in clinical practice, however, is the assurance whether it is safe for patients and continues to be safe after deployment. Differences in patient populations and changes in the data acquisition pose challenges to today's AI algorithms. In this talk we will discuss AI safeguards from the perspective of robustness, reliability, and fairness. We will explore approaches for automatic failure detection, monitoring of performance, and analysis of bias, aiming to ensure the safe and ethical use of medical imaging AI. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Biological sequences, like DNA and protein sequences, encode genetic information essential to life. In recent times, deep learning techniques have transformed biomedical research and applications by modeling the intricate patterns in these sequences. Successful models like AlphaFold and Enformer have paved the way for accurate end-to-end prediction of complex molecular phenotypes from sequences. Such models have profound impact on biomedical research and applications, ranging from understanding basic biology to facilitating drug discovery. This talk will provide an overview of the current techniques and status of biological sequences modeling. Additionally, specific applications of such models in genetics and immunology will be discussed. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Digital traces, such as social media data, supported with advances in the artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) fields, are increasingly being used to understand the mental health of individuals, communities, and populations. However, such algorithms do not exist in a vacuum -- there is an intertwined relationship between what an algorithm does and the world it exists in. Consequently, with algorithmic approaches offering promise to change the status quo in mental health for the first time since mid-20th century, interdisciplinary collaborations are paramount. But what are some paradigms of engagement for AL/ML researchers that augment existing algorithmic capabilities while minimizing the risk of harm? Adopting a social ecological lens, this talk will describe the experiences from working with different stakeholders in research initiatives relating to digital mental health – including with healthcare providers, grassroots advocacy and public health organizations, and people with the lived experience of mental illness. The talk hopes to present some lessons learned by way of these engagements, and to reflect on a path forward that empowers us to go beyond technical innovations to envisioning contributions that center humans’ needs, expectations, values, and voices within those technical artifacts. </p>
