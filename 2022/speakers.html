                <p> Abstract: It has been shown that equalizing health disparities can avert more deaths than the number of lives saved by medical advances alone in the same time frame. Moreover, without a simultaneous focus on innovations and equity, advances in health for one group can occur at the cost of added challenges for another. In this talk I will introduce the science of health disparities and juxtapose it with the machine learning subfield of algorithmic fairness. Given the key foci and principles of health equity and health disparities within public and population health, I will show examples of how machine learning and principles of public and population health can be synergized for using data to advance the science of health disparities and sustainable health of entire populations. </p>

                <p> Abstract: A common goal in genome-wide association (GWA) studies is to characterize the relationship between genotypic and phenotypic variation. Linear models are widely used tools in GWA analyses, in part, because they provide significance measures which detail how individual single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) are statistically associated with a trait or disease of interest. However, traditional linear regression largely ignores non-additive genetic variation, and the univariate SNP-level mapping approach has been shown to be underpowered and challenging to interpret for certain trait architectures. While machine learning (ML) methods such as neural networks are well known to account for complex data structures, these same algorithms have also been criticized as “black box” since they do not naturally carry out statistical hypothesis testing like classic linear models. This limitation has prevented ML approaches from being used for association mapping tasks in GWA applications. In this talk, we present flexible and scalable classes of Bayesian feedforward models which provide interpretable probabilistic summaries such as posterior inclusion probabilities and credible sets which allows researchers to simultaneously perform (i) fine-mapping with SNPs and (ii) enrichment analyses with SNP-sets on complex traits. While analyzing real data assayed in diverse self-identified human ancestries from the UK Biobank, the Biobank Japan, and the PAGE consortium we demonstrate that interpretable ML has the power to increase the return on investment in multi-ancestry biobanks. Furthermore, we highlight that by prioritizing biological mechanism we can identify associations that are robust across ancestries---suggesting that ML can play a key role in making personalized medicine a reality for all. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Machine learning presents an opportunity to understand the patient journey over high dimensional data in the clinical context. This is aligned to one of the foundational issues of machine learning for healthcare: how do you represent a patient state. Improving state representations allows us to (i) visualise/cluster deteriorating patients, (ii) understand the patient journey and thus heterogeneous pathways to improvement or clinical deterioration which encompasses different data modalities; and thus (iii) more quickly identify situations for intervention. In this talk, I present motivating examples of understanding heterogeneity as a route towards understanding health and personalising healthcare interventions. </p>

                <p> Abstract: In my talk, I will describe the work that I have been doing since March 2020, leading a multi-disciplinary team of 20+ volunteer scientists working very closely with the Presidency of the Valencian Government in Spain on 4 large areas: (1) human mobility modeling; (2) computational epidemiological models (both metapopulation, individual and LSTM-based models); (3) predictive models; and (4) a large-scale, online citizen surveys called the COVID19impactsurvey (https://covid19impactsurvey.org) with over 700,000 answers worldwide. This survey has enabled us to shed light on the impact that the pandemic is having on people's lives. I will present the results obtained in each of these four areas, including winning the 500K XPRIZE Pandemic Response Challenge and obtaining a best paper award at ECML-PKDD 2021. I will share the lessons learned in this very special initiative of collaboration between the civil society at large (through the survey), the scientific community (through the Expert Group) and a public administration (through the Commissioner at the Presidency level).

                <p> Abstract: Spoiler alert: No. And yes, it is much, much further. Public health has not traditionally been a data-driven field. The good news is that has been changing in recent years, accelerated significantly by the COVID epidemic. But public health and human services organizations have many more fundamental things to worry about before we will have the luxury of considering what machine learning can enable. These fundamentals include data-related facets such as electronic data capture and exchange, data quality, data governance, information technology infrastructure, and data management best practices. In addition, data literacy, workforce development, and compensation that is a fraction of what 'quants' can earn in industry are also major stumbling blocks toward advanced analytics in public health. At the start of the COVID pandemic, many communicable diseases were reporting by fax machine and then hand-entered into a database. Although there was significant interest in predictive modeling to project hospital capacity out in the future, even the most sophisticated models were of limited use to policy makers beyond basic trends and observations from the front lines. The most notable exception, where AI is in fact proving useful in public health, is in the use of 'robotic process automation' (RPA) as a band-aid for poorly designed systems that require mindless human intervention. These tools serve as workarounds for systems that lack interoperability by emulating human users to do the grunt work of data entry and wrangling. This talk will be  a reality check from the trenches of state government on the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

                <p> Abstract: AI systems tend to amplify biases and disparities. When we feed them data that reflects our biases, they mimic them---from antisemitic chatbots to racially biased software. In this talk I am going to discuss two examples how AI can help us reduce biases and disparities. First I am going to explain how we can use AI to understand why underserved populations experience higher levels of pain. This is true even after controlling for the objective severity of diseases like osteoarthritis, as graded by human physicians using medical images, which raises the possibility that underserved patients’ pain stems from factors external to the knee, such as stress. We develop a deep learning approach to measure the severity of osteoarthritis, by using knee X-rays to predict patients’ experienced pain and show that this approach dramatically reduces unexplained racial disparities in pain. </p>
