                <p> Abstract: Until today, all the available therapeutics are designed by human experts, with no help from AI tools. This reliance on human knowledge and dependence on large-scale experimentations result in prohibitive development cost and high failure rate. Recent developments in machine learning algorithms for molecular modeling aim to transform this field. In my talk, I will present state-of-the-art approaches for property prediction and de-novo molecular generation, describing their use in drug design. In addition, I will highlight unsolved algorithmic questions in this field, including confidence estimation, pretraining, and deficiencies in learned molecular representations. </p>

                <p> Abstract: Improved healthcare delivery and patient outcomes are the ultimate goals of many AI applications in healthcare. However, relatively few machine learning models have been translated to clinical practice so far and among those even fewer have undergone a randomized control trial (RCT) to assess their impact. This talk will highlight aspects of the clinical translational process, beyond retrospective modeling, that impact design, development, validation, and regulation of machine learning models in healthcare. In particular, this talk focuses on our recent study of predicting favorable outcomes in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The resulting model, which was deployed and prospectively validated at NYU Langone, underwent an RCT, and was eventually shared with other institutions. I will discuss challenges around integrating our model in the EHR system and their implications, the efficacy and safety results of our RCT, and practical insights about sharing models across clinics. We will end the talk by reviewing results of a survey of over 195 clinical users who interacted with this model, summarizing when and how the model was most helpful. </p>

                <p> Abstract: In early March 2020, Mark joined an interdisciplinary team to launch the Pandemic Response Network. Over the subsequent months, he helped build and launch programs to support health workers, university students and staff, small businesses, K-12 public schools, and historically marginalized communities through the COVID-19 pandemic. With a strong background in design and implementation of high-tech health innovations, Mark worked alongside public health practitioners and community leaders to repeatedly execute the last mile implementation of critical COVID-19 programs, including symptom monitoring in the workplace, rapid antigen testing in schools, and pop-up vaccination events in churches. The portfolio of programs rapidly shifted health care capabilities and expertise out of hospitals and clinics into community settings that were poorly supported by existing public health infrastructure. The experience forced Mark and his team to approach technology design with a new set of assumptions and led to the development of completely novel data streams and technology systems. In his talk, Mark distills insights and learnings from the front lines of the COVID-19 response and highlights important implications and opportunities for the field of machine learning and artificial intelligence in health care. </p>

                <p> Abstract: In medicine, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools could lead to a paradigm shift in which human-AI collaboration becomes integrated in medical decision-making. Despite many years of enthusiasm towards these technologies, the majority of tools fail once they are deployed in the real-world, often due to failures in workflow integration and interface design. In this talk, I will share research using methods in human-computer interaction (HCI) to design and evaluate machine learning tools for real-world clinical use. Results from this work suggest that trends in explainable AI may be inappropriate for clinical environments. I will discuss paths towards designing these tools for real-world medical systems, and describe how we are using collaborations across medicine, data science, and HCI to create machine learning tools for complex medical decisions. </p>

                <p> Abstract: The wide adoption of electronic health records (EHR) systems has led to the availability of large clinical datasets available for precision medicine research. EHR data, linked with bio-repository, is a valuable new source for deriving real-word, data-driven prediction models of disease risk and treatment response. Yet, they also bring analytical difficulties. Precise information on clinical outcomes is not readily available and requires labor intensive manual chart review. Synthesizing information across healthcare systems is also challenging due to heterogeneity and privacy. In this talk, I’ll discuss analytical approaches for mining EHR data with a focus on denoising, scalability and transportability . These methods will be illustrated using EHR data from multiple healthcare centers. </p>
